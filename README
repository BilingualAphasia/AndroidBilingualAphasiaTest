This is code which was used give the eBAT pdfs (http://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/research/bat/ a collection of over 50 Bilingual Assessments for Aphasia made open and free by Dr. Paradis and his collaborators)  "eyes and ears" for the Bilingual Aphasia Test Android app (Cook, Marquis, Achim 2011 presented at The Academy of Aphasia 2011 - Montreal)). To know more about the architecture you can look at the diagram for the Android section in this pdf:

You can think of this as the Participant's side of the project.  The tool has three functions

1. Record audio video and touch for each subsection of the BAT
2. Enter participant's id, it will autogenerate the participant code etc
3. Backup results to a laptop by wifi after the experiment, and replay participant result videos 


There are some WACHME YouTube Videos http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF468B25FFEF8EAF9 to show what this project does. The project will also be on the Android Market when we think it is ready for random users (ie, after we have WATCHMEs which tell the user how to use it).

The audience of this page:

* open source programmers
* researchers who program, or have a programmer in their team who can adapt the code to their needs

Related Projects:

* If you are interested in the Android Bilingual Aphasia Test, you might also be interested in another project, https://github.com/iLanguage/BilingualAphasiaTestScorer, which can turn a csv spread sheet into a BAT patient profile. It is also an HTML5 WebApp, you can use it online at http://ilanguage.github.com/BilingualAphasiaTestScorer/index.html or fork the code to modify it to your needs.
* If you are interested in analyzing the Android BAT data you might be interested in another poject which is a WebApp which uses existing Open Source software to extract and analyze touch, eye gaze and audio data. The software it uses runs on Macs and Linux Machines.
https://github.com/iLanguage/OPrime it is complicated to set up so contact us if you need help.
