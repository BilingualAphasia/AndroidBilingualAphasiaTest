This is code which was used give the pdf "eyes and ears" for the Bilingual Aphasia Test Android app (Cook, Marquis, Achim 2011 presented at The Academy of Aphasia 2011 - Montreal)). To know more about the architecture you can look at the Participant Android App in this pdf: http://ilanguagelab.googlecode.com/files/cook%2Cmarquis%2Cachim-2011-Aphasia_assesment_on_Android_recording_voice_eye_gaze_and_touch_for_the_BAT_compressed.pdf

You can think of this as the Participant's side of the project.  The tool has three functions

1. Record audio video and touch for each subsection of the BAT
2. Enter participant first and last name, autogenerate the participant code etc
3. Backup results to a laptop by wifi after the experiment, and replay participant result videos 


There will be a WACHME  TubeVideo to show what this project does. The project will also be on the Android Market when we think it is ready for random users (ie, after we have WATCHMEs which tell the user how to use it).


The audience of this project:

* open source programmers
* researchers who program, or have a programmer in their team who can adapt the code to their needs


You will probably be interested in the Experiementer's WebApp too, it runs on any laptop that has Chrome, Firefox or Safari (its HTML5).

The next steps:

To encourage us  you can "watch" our project, "fork" the code, and even send us "pull requests" if you want to contribute your modifications.
